# Bikesharing Challenge

Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to take a in depth look into the Citi Bike data for the month of August. Citi Bike is potentially a Des Moines, IA based bike rental business that rents bikes to consumers throughout the city. This bike trip analysis will help investors understand the core demographic of Citi Bike and why investing in this business will be a profitable endeavor. 

Results
The analysis starts by identifying the highest volume of bikers in the month of August by hours in a normal day. The results are as follows:

Peak bike hours appear to between the hours of 5pm and 7pm. The next highest volume time slot is in the morning around 7am to 9am. It is assessed that these hours before and after normal business hours where bikers are able to rent around their work schedule.

The next graphic captures the renter demographics:

Of the 2,344,224 renters recorded in the month of August, roughly 1,530,272 where male, 588,431 were female, and 225,521 identified as other. This makes males the largest demographic of bikers making up approximately 65%.

The next step was to look at the average duration of bike rentals and compare that with the average bike duration by gender. The following chart takes a look at the average trip duration in hours:

Average bike duration appears to be under one hour with the largest majority of rentals taking lasting within 20 mins. This appears to be consistent between the genders as illustrated by the second chart.

The next set of charts capture rental volume by hour for each weekday using a heatmap. The first chart captures the general times for all rentals while the second chart captures this information by gender.

The heatmaps reinforce the findings indicated at the beginning of this analysis. Peak times appear to be between the hours of 7am to 9am and then 5pm to 7pm during the weekday. The weekends appear to be different as there is more volume between midday and 5pm. This is assessed to be because most renters are not working on these days and have more time to bike later in the day. This pattern appears to be consistent across all demographics.

The final chart looks at the type of users that utilize the bike rental service by gender per day. The two categories of renters are general “customers” and “subscribers.”

Subscribers appear to be the largest demographic of consumers for Male and Female consumers. Those in the Other category appear to be made up of general customers without a subscription. 

Summary

Male working bikers are the largest demographic of customers as indicted by the analysis. This is supported by not only the general number of renters recorded, but the times in which this demographic utilizes this service. Peak volume appears to be before and after normal work hours, so the target customer is assessed to be young working professionals. 

One additional visualization that would be useful in this analysis would be the average trip durations on the weekends as this would provide more information on customer patterns. It would also help in identifying bikes that may require more maintenance after long trips.

Another visualization that would help our analysis is most used routes. This could be done by looking more closely at the start and end stations to determine the most frequented locations. This would provide more useful information on consumer patterns and may also open the door for more business opportunities through partnerships with local businesses or marketing opportunities for items related to biking.
